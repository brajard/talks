Title : Assimilation of non-conventional observations. 
Application to the estimating of ocean surface currents.

Data assimilation consists in optimally combining observations of a system with 
outputs of a numerical model. In the traditionnal approaches, observations are
are considered to be eulerian and scalar. Recently, in the field 
of earth and ocean
observations, there is an increasing number of obsvervations 
that are fundamentally
non-eulerian and/or non scalars: Drifters and floats are advected 
by currents and bring a lagrangian observation through 
their successive positions,
satellite data are giving images that contains structured patterns.
In this talk, we show a application of data assimilation for blending 
altimetry and surface drifters data in the Eastern Levantine Mediterranean.
The method is based on a variational assimilation approach for which 
the velocity is corrected by matching real drifters positions 
with those predicted by a simple advection model, 
while taking into account the wind effect.
