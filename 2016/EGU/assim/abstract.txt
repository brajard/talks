ENSEMBLE VARIATIONAL DATA ASSIMILATION WITH A SHALLOW WATER MODEL :
PRELIMINARY RESULTS

The objective of ensemble data assimilation is to produce an ensemble of analysis
from observations and a numerical model
which is representative of the uncertainty of the system. In a bayesian framework, the ensemble
represents a sampling of the state vector probability distribution conditioned to the available knowledge 
of the system, denoted the a-posteriori probability distribution.

Ensemble variational data assimilation (EnsVar) consists in producing such an ensemble by 
perturbating N times the observations according to their error law, and run
a standard variationnal assimilation for each perturbation.
An ensemble of N members is then produced. In the case of linear models, 
there is a theoretical guarantee
that this ensemble is a sampling of the a-posteriori probability.
But there is no theoretical result in the
non-linear case.

Numerical experiments using non-linear numerical models suggest that the
conclusion reached for linear models still stands for non linear toy models.

The objective of the present work is to show preliminary results of EnsVar applied to a more
realistic model : a shallow-water model. Some statistical properties of the ensemble 
are presented, and the sensitivity to the main features of the assimilation system (number,
distribution of observations, size of the assimilation window, ...) are also studied.
