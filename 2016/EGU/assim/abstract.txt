ENSEMBLE VARIATIONAL DATA ASSIMILATION WITH A SHALLOW WATER MODEL :
PRELIMINARY RESULTS

The objective of ensemble data assimilation is to produce an ensemble of analysis
from observations and a numerical model
which is representative of the uncertainty of the system. In a baysian framework, the ensemble
represents a sampling of the state vector probability knowing the observations
of the system, denoted the a-posteriori probability.

Ensemble variational data assimilation (EnVar) consists in produce such an ensemble by 
perturbating N times the observations following their error law, and run
an standard variationnal assimilation for each perturbation.
An ensemble of N members is then produced. In the case of linear models, 
there is a theorictical guarantee
that this ensemble is a sampling of the a-posteriori probability.
But there is no theortical result in the
non-linear case.

Some numerical experiment using non-linear numerical model suggest that the
conclusion reached for linear models still stands for non linear toy models.

The objectif of the present work is to show preliminary results of EnVar applied to a more
realistic model : a shallow-water model. Some statistical properties of the ensemble 
are presented, and the sensitivity to the main features of the assimilation system (number,
distribution of observations, size of the assimilation window, ...) are also studied.
